# Conclusion
Q1) As we look into the analysis, We can conclude that we need atleast 5 positions to be refilled during the "silver tsunami".
Q2) As we look at the Data Analysis, We can conclude almost 1500 employees are eligible for the mentorship program, however we have almost around 100000 employees about to retire, so we can conclude there are enough qualified retiring employees who can train and mentor the new age employees.
